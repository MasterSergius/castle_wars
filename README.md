Castle Wars - old-school TBS game with CLI

This game was created as kind of protest against modern games which mostly
need powerful hardware but don't provide interesting gameplay.
Castle Wars created intentionally with primitive approaches such as redraw
whole screen to demonstrate that the most important part - gameplay.

Game inspired by map "Castle Fights" for great game Warcraft III.

In far future, I plan to create Castle Wars 2.0 with ncurses library which is
a better approach to draw pseudographic. Any help will be appreciated.
Also, different game modes will be available.
